# Run-time flags: envvar TSAN_OPTIONS="';' delimited option list"
# Useful options (full list see https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags):
#   suppressions=<supression_file_name>
#   verbosity=n Verbosity level (0 - silent, 1 - a bit of output, 2+ - more output).
#   history_size=[0..7], default 2
#   detect_deadlocks=0 - some data structs in libcds tests use a lot of node-level mutexes.
#                        TSan has the hardcoded limit =16 for the number of mutex per thread.
#                        To prevent "possibly deadlock" reporting disable deadlock detection.
#                        Suppression can help in that case but stack unwinding increases 
#                        test time significantly.
